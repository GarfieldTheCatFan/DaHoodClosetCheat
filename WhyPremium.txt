# Premium Commands

:BRING {PLAYER}
:FREEZE {PLAYER} 
OR 
:THAW{PLAYER}

:BAN {PLAYER} | NOT AN ACTUAL BAN ITS A TROLL BAN
:KILL {PLAYER}

(By the way, if you buy multiple premiums, you get multiple emojis too. like when you get all of the premiums, you get all 3 emojis at the same time.)

Non premium users I'm sorry. You might get tormented and everything, BUT, we have cheap premium :blush: .

(I'm gonna add HWID whitelist soon so you can use premium on multiple accounts but on that one computer.)
